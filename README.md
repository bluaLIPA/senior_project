This is my senior project. Me with my peers created ChatBot that can answer question related to the KAZGUU University Library including :
 - Information about books and their existence and location in the library
 - Infrastructure of the Library
 - Working hours of the library and so on...
Stack is NodeJS, html, css.

ChatBot is working using free OpenAI API. 

Some enhanced functionality :
ChatBot can say everything by voice when special button is clicked
